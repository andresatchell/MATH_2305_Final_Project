Definition of  Prim's algorithm

Prim, is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. 
It finds a tree of that graph which includes every vertex and the total weight of all the edges in the tree is less than or equal to every possible spanning tree. 
Prim's algorithm is faster on dense graphs.
